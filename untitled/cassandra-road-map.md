## Educational Road Map

### Stage 1. Vocational

Due to hurdles of accreditation the largest and fastest impact from open access education will be through focusing on Vocational and skill based educations, where students can create a portfolio to prove their skills and the education that they have gained.

### Stage 2. Making Educational Resources Available

The next stage is to move to more theoretical educations and to expanding into as many languages as possible. This will be an ongoing effort to providing resources and coercing institutions to open up their resources.

### Stage 3. Accreditation

The Final and most difficult stage is to start mass accreditation of more theory based educations, which will allow students to get full accreditations at no cost to them.
